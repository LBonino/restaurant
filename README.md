# restaurant
A simple restaurant homepage.

This project is part of [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page).

You can visit the page clicking [here](https://lbonino.github.io/restaurant/).

## How does this work?
The page is divided into 3 tabs: Home, Menu and Contact. When you click the name of a tab, JavaScript code is run to load the tab content. It also underlines the clicked tab button to mark it as selected.

## What is the point of this project?
- Practice DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering the contents of the restaurant homepage. 
- Introduce the use of a module bundler and package manager (webpack and npm respectively).
- Start using ES6 modules to split up programs.
